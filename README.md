### cdn links
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/adva-effect@1.0.1/style.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/adva-effect@1.0.1/index.js"></script>
```

or `npm i adva-effect`<br/>
this will not work in react or similar stuff, maybe you could help?

Now just add `class="adva"` and you're good to go.
